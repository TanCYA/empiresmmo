Long description

A persistent strategy mmo written in java were each player have one or more villages to manage, defend or expand. The player will manage his village adding buildings, exploring resources, creating crops , creating units, and so on. The battles will not be on-line, so anyone can atack any village anytime without the village owner interacting. The attacks will consist of the enemy army invading the village and the buildings defending themselves in turns, where the position of the buildings will be determinant in the attack results.

The player can conquer a village he attacked. Beside human players an AI will be playing and the game era will change everytime the AI gets defeated.

By configuring some settings it will be possible to play a quick game (in a local network for example) or a really long game. The game will be able to run with an embedded server.
